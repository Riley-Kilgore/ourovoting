# Ourovoting

Ouravoting is a family of protocols that allows for voting on proposals and the allocation of treasury funds. We aim to replicate Cardano's principles of governance & security within the EUTXO framework. This allows token-governance for decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) and the associated tokenomics.

Thanks to Zygomeb (Optim) & Riley (Summon) for various design ideas and discussions.
